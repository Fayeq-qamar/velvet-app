üßµ THREAD: We built AI for neurodivergent minds. Here's why it matters.

1/ Most productivity tools: "Just use a calendar!"
Our brains: "But what if the calendar judges me?"

2/ Velvet AI gets it. It doesn't try to make us neurotypical.
Instead, it works WITH our beautifully chaotic minds.

3/ Real features that matter:
- Social decoder for "what did they ACTUALLY mean?"
- Gentle task breakdown (no shame, just support)
- Pattern recognition for distraction spirals

4/ Beta tester: "It's like having a friend who understands executive dysfunction"

5/ Want to try it? We're looking for 100 neurodivergent beta testers.
