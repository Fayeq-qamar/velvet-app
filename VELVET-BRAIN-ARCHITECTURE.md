# 🧠 Velvet Brain Architecture
## *The Unified AI Consciousness System*

> **Vision**: Transform Velvet from scattered features into one unified AI consciousness that truly understands and supports neurodivergent minds.

---

## 🎯 **Core Philosophy**

### **The Problem**
Current Velvet has amazing features scattered across different systems:
- Screen OCR reading text
- Audio monitoring detecting sounds  
- Screen intelligence tracking behavior
- Meeting assistant providing coaching
- Task system managing goals
- Social decoder translating communication

**But they don't work as ONE unified intelligence.**

### **The Solution: Velvet Brain**
A central consciousness that:
- **Observes everything** through multiple sensory inputs
- **Understands context** by correlating all data streams
- **Learns patterns** unique to each user's neurodivergent brain
- **Responds as one personality** with perfect timing and tone
- **Remembers everything** to provide increasingly personalized support

### **2. Core Processing Loop**
```javascript
// The 6-Step Thinking Process (runs every 3 seconds)
async think() {
  // 1. PERCEIVE: Gather all sensory data
  const currentState = await this.perceive();
  
  // 2. UNDERSTAND: Process through learned patterns  
  const context = await this.understand(currentState);
  
  // 3. PREDICT: Anticipate user needs
  const predictions = await this.predict(context);
  
  // 4. DECIDE: Choose best intervention
  const action = await this.decide(predictions);
  
  // 5. ACT: Execute through appropriate system
  await this.act(action);
  
  // 6. LEARN: Update patterns and memory
  await this.learn(currentState, action, outcome);
}
```

### **3. Memory & Learning System**
```javascript
VelvetMemory {
  workingMemory: {
    currentContext: "coding session, 47 minutes deep",
    userMood: "focused but slightly frustrated",
    activeApps: ["Cursor", "Chrome", "Spotify"],
    recentPatterns: ["excessive file switching"]
  },
  
  episodicMemory: {
    codingSessions: {
      averageDuration: 73,
      productiveWindows: ["9-11am", "2-4pm"],
      stuckPatterns: ["documentation spirals"],
      successfulInterventions: ["gentle task breakdown"]
    }
  },
  
  semanticMemory: {
    userProfile: {
      neurodivergentType: "ADHD + autism",
      communicationStyle: "direct and gentle",
      triggerPatterns: ["unexpected meetings", "complex decisions"],
      supportPreferences: ["visual breakdowns", "celebration"]
    }
  }
}
```

## 🌟 **Key Differences from Current System**

### **Before: Scattered Features**
```
❌ "Screen OCR detected code"
❌ "Meeting Assistant activated"  
❌ "Nudge system triggered"
❌ "Audio monitoring started"
```

### **After: Unified Consciousness**
```
✅ "I can see you're deep in the Velvet code - you've been switching between files a lot. 
   Your music suggests focus mode, but I sense some frustration. Want me to help organize your thoughts?"

✅ "I notice Sarah joined the call and her tone seems tense. I'm here if you need help reading the room."

✅ "You've been in flow for an hour! I'm holding your notifications and watching for signs you need a break."
```
