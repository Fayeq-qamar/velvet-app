üßµ THREAD: How @VelvetAI just changed my life

1/ I've been struggling with reading social cues my entire career. 
That moment when your boss says "we need to talk" and you spend 
3 days catastrophizing...

2/ Today @VelvetAI's Social Decoder told me my coworker wasn't 
being passive-aggressive - they were actually trying to be helpful 
but stressed about their own deadline.

3/ For the first time, I understood the ACTUAL conversation 
happening instead of the 15 different interpretations my brain 
created. This is what assistive tech should be.

4/ If you're neurodivergent and tired of guessing what people 
really mean, this is the breakthrough we've been waiting for.

#### **Content Strategy**

**1. Professional Breakthrough Stories**
```
Post Template:
"Yesterday, something incredible happened in a team meeting.

For years, I've struggled to understand the subtext in workplace conversations. When colleagues say 'interesting idea' or 'we should discuss this further,' I never knew if they meant it or were politely disagreeing.

Velvet AI's Social Decoder feature just changed everything.

During our quarterly review, when my manager said 'that's an interesting approach,' Velvet helped me understand they were actually expressing genuine curiosity, not dismissing my idea. For the first time, I responded appropriately and confidently.

This is what inclusive technology looks like. Not trying to make us neurotypical, but meeting us where we are.

The future of work is neurodivergent-friendly. Companies investing in tools like this aren't just supporting their ND employees - they're unlocking innovation.

#Neurodiversity #WorkplaceInclusion #AssistiveTechnology #Innovation"

**2. Industry Thought Leadership**
```
"The Accessibility Revolution in AI: What Velvet Gets Right

Three principles every tech company should adopt:

1. Design WITH the community, not FOR it
2. Understand that 'different' doesn't mean 'deficient'  
3. Breakthrough moments drive better product-market fit than feature lists

When we build technology that works for neurodivergent minds, we build technology that works better for everyone.

What other examples of neurodivergent-led innovation have you seen?"
