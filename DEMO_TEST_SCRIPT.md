4. Expected: Context-aware suggestions based on current activity
```

## **8. Voice Commands & TTS**
```javascript

3. Test with multiple apps running
4. Expected: Smooth performance without system slowdown
5. Check memory usage over time
6. Expected: Stable memory footprint, no leaks
```

## **Success Criteria**
- âœ… All voice interactions work (transcription + AI + TTS)
- âœ… Both AI personalities respond appropriately (warm vs professional)
- âœ… Screen monitoring detects patterns without breaking other apps
- âœ… Real-time OCR extracts and classifies screen content
- âœ… System runs smoothly with <20% CPU usage
- âœ… Context awareness correlates screen + behavior + voice input

## **5-Minute Demo Flow**
1. **Show glass orb** â†’ Voice chat with warm Velvet personality
2. **Open Meeting Assistant** â†’ Professional co-pilot response
3. **Demonstrate pattern detection** â†’ Rapid tab switching triggers intervention
4. **Screen intelligence** â†’ OCR reading current content
5. **End with vision** â†’ "This is neurodivergent support that actually understands our brains"
