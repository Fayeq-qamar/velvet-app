# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Vision

**Velvet**: "Soft support for sharp minds" - A neurodivergent-friendly AI assistant desktop app providing gentle, intelligent support for ADHD, autism, OCD, and executive dysfunction. Think "gentle companion that understands your brain."

## Development Commands

```bash
# NEW: Professional microservices architecture
./start-velvet-services.sh    # Start all services (Rust + Python + Electron)
./stop-velvet-services.sh     # Stop all services gracefully

# Legacy single commands (still work)
npm run dev        # Run Electron app only (services must be started separately)
npm run start      # Run in production mode
npm run build      # Build using webpack (planned: migrate to Vite)
npm test           # Currently outputs "No tests yet"
```

**Environment setup:**
- Requires `.env` file with `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`
- **Rust toolchain** for capture service
- **Python 3.8+** with venv for preprocessing worker
- **macOS Screen Recording permissions** for screen capture

## Current Architecture

**Main Process** (`src/main/index.js`):
- Electron window management with transparency and always-on-top
- IPC handlers for OpenAI Whisper transcription
- IPC handlers for ElevenLabs TTS
- Environment variable access via dotenv

**Renderer Process** (`public/index.html` + `public/renderer.js`):
- Glassmorphism UI with floating orb and expandable chat
- Click-outside-to-close functionality
- Visual state management for different AI modes

**AI Module** (`src/renderer/ai.js`):
- GPT-4 integration with neurodivergent-optimized personality
- Conversation history management
- Response optimization (2-3 sentences max, no overwhelming questions)

**Voice Module** (`src/renderer/voice-whisper.js`):

- Base64 audio encoding for IPC transfer
- ElevenLabs TTS playback with gentle voice settings

## Core Design Philosophy

**Language & Tone Guidelines:**
- ‚úÖ Warm, conversational language acknowledging emotions first
- ‚úÖ Celebrate every small win, validate struggles
- ‚úÖ Break tasks into micro-steps, use "we" for collaboration
- ‚ùå Never use "just focus/do it", clinical language, shame/guilt, time pressure

**UI/UX Principles:**
- Glass morphism with blue-to-black theme
- One-handed mobile-friendly design
- Calm, uncluttered interfaces with soft animations
- Large touch targets, everything skippable/dismissible
- Multiple ways to accomplish tasks

## Key User Scenarios (Planned)

1. **Task Avoidance**: "I see you opening that document - it feels big, doesn't it? What if we just add the title?"
2. **Hyperfocus Protection**: "You're in the zone! Just checking: moved your body in the last hour?"
3. **Distraction Spiral**: "Lots of mental tabs open! Want to brain dump, then pick ONE thing?"

## Implementation Priority

1. ‚úÖ Core floating UI with glassmorphism design
2. ‚úÖ Basic voice chat with OpenAI integration
3. ‚úÖ Screen monitoring for window/tab tracking
4. ‚úÖ Pattern recognition for basic interventions
5. ‚úÖ Intention-based task coaching system
6. üöß Stealth mode functionality
7. üöß Advanced AI personality modes
8. üöß Full invisible mode with capture exclusion
9. üöß Ambient audio awareness

## Testing & Development Functions

**Built-in test functions available in browser console:**

**Pattern Detection Tests:**
```javascript
testNudges.hyperfocus()        // Test 45+ min focus detection
testNudges.distractionSpiral() // Test rapid tab switching detection
testNudges.taskAvoidance()     // Test app open/close pattern detection
testNudges.idle()              // Test idle time detection
```

**Intention-Based Task System Tests:**
```javascript
testSystem.testTaskDeclaration()  // Test "I need to..." detection
testSystem.testIntentMonitoring() // Test deviation from expected apps
testSystem.testStepCompletion()   // Test manual step completion
testSystem.showTaskState()        // Show current task state
```

**Usage Example:**
1. Open developer console (F12)
2. Run `testSystem.testTaskDeclaration()` to create a task
3. Run `testSystem.testIntentMonitoring()` to see deviation guidance
4. Run `testSystem.testStepCompletion()` to mark steps complete

## Development Notes

**Current Technical Debt:**
- Vanilla JS should migrate to React + TypeScript
- No state management system (needs Zustand)
- No database layer (needs SQLite with encryption)
- Basic CSS instead of Tailwind
- Security settings are development-focused (nodeIntegration: true)

**API Integration:**
- OpenAI Whisper: Handled in main process via HTTPS requests
- OpenAI GPT-4: Handled in renderer process via fetch
- ElevenLabs TTS: Handled in main process, voice ID `m7GHBtY0UEqljrKQw2JH`

**Critical Configuration:**
- Window: Frameless, transparent, always-on-top, positioned bottom-right
- Voice: Gentle settings (stability: 0.75, similarity_boost: 0.30)
- AI: Max 120 tokens, temperature 0.8, focused on short helpful responses
