## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-31

### üõ°Ô∏è **BULLETPROOF STEALTH SYSTEM - MAJOR RELEASE**

#### Added
- **Permanent stealth mode** - All windows invisible to screen capture without detection delays
- **5-layer protection system** with content protection, window cycling, opacity cycling, process masking, and window properties
- **Universal window protection** - Main app, control panel, meeting assistant, and checklist all hidden from screen capture
- **Auto-stealth for new windows** - Automatic protection applied to any newly created window
- **macOS optimization** with command line switches and NSWindow integration
- **Smart container system** - Click-through behavior when closed, interactive when open
- **Process masking** - App disguises as system services (com.apple.coreaudio, etc.)

#### Fixed
- **Window flickering** in screen capture - eliminated rapid on/off switching
- **Container interference** - windows only interfere with other apps when actually open
- **Ugly square blocks** - proper window sizing and opacity restoration
- **Discord stream ending** - removed problematic setContentProtection calls that terminated streams
- **False detection triggers** - stealth no longer activates when opening Velvet's own windows

#### Technical Improvements
- **Stable detection system** with debouncing to prevent rapid state changes
- **Micro-opacity cycling** (0.985-1.0) - invisible to screenshots, visible to human eye
- **Dynamic window level rotation** confuses capture systems
- **Command line switches** for macOS content protection compatibility
- **Global hotkeys** for manual stealth control
